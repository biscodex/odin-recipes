    <h3>Description</h3>
    <p>Kesar Pista Kulfi is an ultimate bliss for every sweet lover. Made with some simple ingredients, anyone can make this traditional delight. Filled with the goodness of Kesar and prepared with milk and pistachios. Ideally, sugar is added to the Kesar Pista kulfi to give it a sweet taste, but you can also add condensed milk to make it more creamy.</p>

    <h3>Ingredients</h3>
    <ul>
      <li>1 and 1/2 litre full cream milk</li>
      <li>1/2 cup chopped pistachios</li>
      <li>2 tablespoon milk</li>
      <li>1/2 cup sugar</li>
      <li>10 strands saffron</li>
      <li>1/2 teaspoon powdered green cardamom</li>
    </ul>

    <h3>Steps</h3>
    <ol>
      <li>In a pan, add full cream milk and let it come to a boil. Once done, let it simmer for about 25-30 mins. Stir occasionally. Meanwhile, soak saffron strands in 2 tablespoon warm milk.</li>
      <li>Now, add sugar to milk and mix it well. Let it simmer till the milk thickens and then add pistachios, cardamom powder, and soaked saffron milk. Mix everything well and let it simmer again for 5 mins. Switch off the gas flame and let the milk cool for a while.</li>
      <li>Pour the mixture into kulfi moulds once it has thickened well. Freeze it for at least 4-5 hours.</li>
      <li>Once done, insert a wooden stick inside the kulfi mould and gently take the kulfi out. Top it with chopped pistachios and saffron strands. Your Kesar Pista Kulfi is ready. Enjoy.</li>

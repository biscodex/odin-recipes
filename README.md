Create a recipe page to showcase basic HTML.
 
This is the first project in The Odin Project curriculum. I learned how to create files and directories, navigate through the terminal and fill out the basic HTML boilerplate. I have also learned how to input headers, paragraphs, make ordered and unordered lists and work with links and images.

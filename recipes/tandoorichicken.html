    <h3>Description</h3>
    <p>Tandoori Chicken is a classic recipe that is a favourite among meat lovers. With a charred exterior and juicy, smoky flavour, this dish is a winner in more ways than one. Traditionally, the chicken pieces are marinated in a generous spread of spices and yoghurt, and then grilled on skewers till they reach perfection.</p>

    <h3>Ingredients</h3>
    <ul>
      <li>4 tsp Kashmiri chilli powder</li>
      <li>2 tsp salt</li>
      <li>2 tbsp vegetable oil</li>

      <li>½ tsp Cumin Powder</li>
      <li>1 tsp turmeric powder</li>
      <li>½ tsp cardamom crushed</li>
      <li>¼ tsp Cinnamon crushed</li>
      <li>¼ tsp ground nutmeg</li>
      <li>1 tsp fresh ginger grated</li>
      <li>1 garlic clove peeled and grated</li>
      <li>1 Lemon juiced</li>
    </ul>

Add the red chilli paste and coat the pieces in it. Take a bowl and add yoghurt to it. Then add all the powdered spices, ginger and garlic. Give it a mix.

      <li>Take the marinated chicken pieces and start threading them on the skewers.</li>
      <li>Preheat the oven at 218-degree Celsius. Place the skewers on a baking sheet and bake the kebabs for 5-8 minutes per side.
